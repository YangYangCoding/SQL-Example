# SQL-Example
Show how to create table in DB, how to write view, function, procedure, trigger and other DB skills

All the examples are based on the DB which you need to run create_table.sql and insert_to_table.sql to create it.

If you have the table with the same name in your DB, please rename it or drop it. You can also rename my table.

Have fun!
